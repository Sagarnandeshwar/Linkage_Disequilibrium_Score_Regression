# Linkage_Disequilibrium_Score_Regression
Implement the very basic LD score regression algorithm with Python to estimate the heritability of the phenotype.

## Dataset
For a phenotype of interest, we have collected the marginal statistics $\tilde{\beta}$ for M = 4268 SNPs and the MxM LD matrix R (i.e., pairwise SNP-SNP Pearson correlation). The marginal statistics are based on N = 1000 individuals.

## Assumption 
There is no population stratification in this dataset. Both phenotype and genotype were standardized.
